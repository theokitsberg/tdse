            <p class="question">What's your name?</p>
            <p class="answer">I prefer to stay anonymous</p>
            
            <p class="question">And what do you do for work?</p>
            <p class="answer">Director of a Mystery Shopping Department</p>
            
            <p class="question">Do you enjoy it? (+ why/why not?)</p>
            <p class="answer">Very much - I am using my expertise to help organisations improve their output - my clients are grateful, I see real results and I enjoy planning and executing the projects</p>
            
            <p class="question">What are good signs that someone might enjoy doing what you do and be good at it?</p>
            <p class="answer">When clients see their bottom line increases</p>
            
            <p class="question">Did you always know you wanted to do what you do?</p>
            <p class="answer">No, I loved research and wanted to do something with it that would actually make a difference to companies</p>
            
            <p class="question">What else did you consider doing?</p>
            <p class="answer">Teaching</p>
            
            <p class="question">Any advice for someone who does know they want to do what you do?</p>
            <p class="answer">Work on your presentation skills as well as the research skills</p>
            
            <p class="question">Are there any misconceptions people might have about what it's like to do what you do?</p>
            <p class="answer">They think its just easy to design the projects, but actually you need the mystery shoppers to appear natural and not be spotted, yet you need to extract a huge amount of data, so you need to be able to produce a scenario and script that is easy to memorise and execute whilst giving a lot of useful data, It's not as straight forward as people think</p>
