            <p class="question">What's your name?</p>
            <p class="answer">I'd prefer to stay anon if that's ok.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Yeah, of course - what do you do for work?</p>
            <p class="answer">Graphic design but unemployed atm.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Do you enjoy it?</p>
            <p class="answer">I do enjoy it because of the strategy and ability to create a feeling or aid in decision making through creativity.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What are good signs that someone might enjoy doing graphic design and be good at it?</p>
            <p class="answer">Good signs are taste, strategic thinking, empathy for people's needs and wants, technical chops, good time management.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Did you always know you wanted to do graphic design?</p>
            <p class="answer">No, I considered art, architecture, law, biology, psychology, product design and am still interested in them.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Any advice for someone who does know that they want to do graphic design?</p>
            <p class="answer">1. Make a lot of work</p>
            <p class="answer">2. Don't be scared to steal / copy work you like (unless you're selling it), it's how all the greats learn.</p>
            <p class="answer">3. Don't be scared to be shit, your first design will ALWAYS be dodo (just how it works) so just start and get the bad ones out of your system</p>
            
            <p class="question">Lastly, any misconceptions people might have about what it's like to do graphic design?</p>
            <p class="answer">Some ppl think it's just about making things look pretty, no. It's about communicating. A feeling, a message, an idea. But with text and visuals.</p>
