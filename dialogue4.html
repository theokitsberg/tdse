            <p class="question">Did you always know you wanted to do what you do?</p>
            <p class="answer">Not immediately but was inspired by seeing other doctors during work experience.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What else did you consider doing?</p>

            <p class="question">Are there any misconceptions people might have about what it's like to do what you do?</p>
            <p class="answer">That we just follow orders from consultants without thinking, when actually we're constantly making decisions and managing patients ourselves.</p>
